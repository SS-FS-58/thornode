Thornode Infrastructure
========================

This contains infrastructure documentation and code to build and manage a
thornode.

## Deploy
To deploy a thornode using these scripts, you will need to install
[terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). You will also want to install `make`
as well.

Once you have that installed, you can build a thornode cluster with the
following command...
```bash
make apply
```
